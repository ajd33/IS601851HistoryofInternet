    <p>The internet is on par with the printing press, the wheel and language. It is the communications platform for the 21st century and although it has only been recently invented, it has been adopted quickly and has surpassed any other technology for communication. Computers first started as standalone machines, filling entire rooms. The internet we know today is far more complex and widely used than what a 1950’s computer programmer could have imagined.</p>
    <p>One of the 1st milestones of the internet is the invention of queueing theory by Leonard Kleinrock in 1962. This was the network framework for how data could be transferred from one computer to another. Data would be put into specially designed packets and transfer through nodes which function somewhat like a post office, accepting a message then passing it on. This theory would not be implemented until many years later. In 1969, Bob Taylor and Larry Roberts created one of the first computer networks at ARPA. They wanted to be able to control multiple computers from one terminal instead of each computer having solely its own dedicated terminal. The idea quickly grew to involve sharing files between computers. They created a network made up of identical mini-computers called IMPs which transfer the data packets. That way, individual computers only needed to be programmed to talk to one type of computer, the IMP, and not each individual computer on the network. This 1st network was called the ARPA net between a handful of universities in the south west US. This network quickly grew to other Universities around the country. The contents of the data being transferred was basic, but it worked!</p>
    <p>The next major breakthrough was text messaging in 1971, invented by Raymond Tomlinson. The @ symbol was also coined by him. Computer networks continued to grow across the country. Local area networks (LANs) connected computers within buildings and Wide Area Networks (WANs) linked from building to building. However, each new network could not talk to other networks, they were all speaking their own language. A network to connect these networks was developed in the 1970’s called transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP). This “gateway” network became the standard common network by the 1980’s and is the backbone of the internet we know today.</p>
    <p>The world wide web which had easier navigation by using clickable hyperlinks and URLs was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee. The web browser was invented shortly after which had an interface that anyone could use. All this time, computers had been growing smaller and cheaper which enabled more and more people to have their own computer to access the internet. Today, nearly everyone uses the internet and it has reshaped communication entirely. Detailed information such as live video can be shared or received instantaneously almost anywhere in the world, all over the internet.</p>
