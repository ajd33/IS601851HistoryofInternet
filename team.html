        <h2>William Herman</h2>
        <p>William grew up in Tinton Falls, NJ and developed a passion for information technology while recognizing the impact bad data can have on a corporation while interning. He had the goal to work on an in house application where he would be able to have a major impact on the way the application is used and works. This passion and goal was ignited while working on a nonprofit's Salesforce and after graduating with a degree in MIS he started working full time in a tile factory as an IT administrator. After a few months his passion began to burn less bright, as the frustration of working with IT vendors made him feel useless and not critical to his company's success. William received a job offer to be a system admin for a company's in house contract management system where he currently works while working to obtain a Master's of Science in Information Systems.</p>
