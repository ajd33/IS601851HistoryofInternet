    <p>When the web was in its infancy, the content of most web pages was generated by the website creators. Media was produced and consumed much like television where there are much fewer producers of media and a large audience. Today, much of the most popular content on the web is user generated. Facebook, youtube and dig are all examples of this. The web has enabled platforms for user generated media to be broadcast easily and it has changed the landscape of media itself.<p/>
    <p>Before the web, if you wanted to make a video available for the world to see. You needed someone to publish it for you such as a TV channel or movie company. This was not an easy matter, producers control the content that gets shown on their platform. Do you think Pixar will make a movie about your dog? It’s easy to see that the was a large barrier to entry. Now with youtube, you can upload videos of your dog filmed on your smartphone and there’s nothing stopping millions of people from watching it.  The media titans can no longer control what gets produced and distributed. Everyone is now capable of producing and sharing their own media to the world on websites like youtube.</p>
    <p>Another aspect of users controlling media now is user vetting. Also known as liking or up voting. Some platforms such as reddit or dig have a front page. The media that is on their front page is the most highly user vetted media so if a picture of your dog get enough upvotes, it may make it to the front page of reddit for millions to see. Digg is a news website that also has a front page, except it shows news articles.</p>

    <p>Music media also been changed by the web. The most recent “old” model was CD’s. If you liked a song and wanted to own it so you can play it when you want, you need to buy the physical CD. If the song you wanted was not a “single” then you would be forced to buy the whole album which usually had a dozen or so songs. The next big change past CD’s was the MP3 file. MP3 was an audio file format that could take a song and compress it into a few megabytes which was something you could download. The ability to distribute songs over the internet was largely enabled by MP3’s.</p>
    <img src=".\images\cds.png" alt="Compact Disks">
    <p>Since MP3’s were easy to share, record labels quickly lost control of the distribution of them. Napster famously became an incredibly MP3 sharing website where all its content was free. Users on Napster could share albums and song easily to other users with no money exchange. This was a major hit to record label revenues and Napster was shortly in a legal battle with them. Popular artists such as Metallica openly joined this battle against MP3 sharing. Controversially, Metallica famously confronted Napster and requested for them to ban all of the users sharing their songs. Eventually, the records labels won in court and Napster was shut down. However, this did not stop peer to peer file sharing or slow the downfall of record sales.</p>
    <p>Web 2.0 is a term describing this user generated media craze. Now, much of the media being consumed is user generated. The popularity of this media is not controlled easily and is rather unpredictable. For example, Rupert Murdock purchased myspace, but despite the purchase and money put into myspace, Facebook ultimately won despite being a website started in a college dorm by Mark Zuckerberg. The people chose Facebook as the preferred social media platform. This is a prime example of a user consensus deciding the outcome of a media platform. No longer is media controlled by a small group of people, it is now controlled by the many, the users themselves.</p>
