    <p> Internet search has become as ubiquitous as the telephone. It is an invaluable tool that brings information to our fingertips as quickly as possible. The weather, game scores and height of your favorite favorite actor are all just a quick search away. It is amazing to think that this technology did not exist just 30 years ago. Prior to the search engine, there were numerous directory lists cataloged by hand for the world wide web, like independently authored encyclopedias.<p/>
    <img src=".\images\yahoo.png" alt="Yahoo">
    <p>Yahoo was one of the first popular directories. In 1995, they added a keyword search function to their directory. It was one of the most popular ways for people to find web pages at the time. Yahoo also became one of the 1st companies to make a substantial amount of money on the web by having a widely viewed banner ad and it’s often credited for starting the web boom. By 1996 there were a number of competitors, Altavista, Magellan and Excite for example. Excite was the first to use software based search instead of hand indexed search, this technology is what modern web search is based on today.</p>
    <p>Early day search engine websites like Yahoo become bloated with features like chat, email, stocks, etc. while the search engine technology remained the same. You could spend hours searching with keywords and different phrases never finding what you were searching for. It was very rudimentary compared to today’s search.</p>
    <p>Larry Page and Sergey Brin invented Google and developed a search engine which used hyperlinks to measure the quality of the websites it was indexing. This was modeled after an algorithm developed by Robin Li in 1996. The basic concept is that the more other sites link to a website, then the more popular it is which also correlates to how relevant it is to your search. For example, if you search watermelon on Google then you’re likely to get the most popular “watermelon” website, the one most linked to by other websites, and not just a rudimentary watermelon website created by a student which is hardly even linked to. </p>
    <p>During this time, the web search market was rather crowded and there wasn’t a lot of revenue from search itself. Web search homepages had banner ads and that’s where they generated revenue. Yahoo still dominated with its “here’s the Yahoo web” for you AOL type webpage and there were several other web search web sites. Google’s approach was rather unique since it didn’t show any ads on it’s main webpage. It was only “Google”, a search bar, “search” and “I’m Feeling Lucky” on a white background.</p>
    <img src=".\images\google.png" alt="Network">
    <p>Overture was the first website to have a yellow pages like model where the search results were paid for. The top search result for Bob Dylan could be paid for by a record company. Overture was not as good with it’s search technology when compared to Google, but it generated much more revenue. Google and overture had a number of meetings, but ultimately no partnership. Instead, Google copied the overture model and started doing paid ads, except it separated these paid ads from its regular results. Google quickly became the most popular search engine.</p>
    <p>Google became public traded and started the internet economy we know today. Google quickly became one of the most valued companies in the world in the likes of Walmart, Microsoft and Apple. Google started going into other technologies and dominates many of them such as online maps and youtube. It is currently the most visited website on earth with 96% web search market share as of June 2019 with 5.4 billion searches each day.</p>
