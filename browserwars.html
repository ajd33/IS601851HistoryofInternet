            In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee wrote a proposal to join hypertext with the internet. He had taken the step to combine hypertext, the internet, multi font text objects and formulate those thoughts into the ENQUIRE system to create the World Wide Web. Marc Andreessen was fascinated by the World Wide Web and imagined a future where people would use the web as a part of their daily lives and not just for entertainment or research. This was the catalyst for Marc and some of his pals to create Mosaic, freely available online as a beta. They had sent the browser to a select population of twelve people, however it’s contagious spread to the Internet becoming a revolution.

            Stanford University professor Jim Clark came across Mosaic and was astonished at the invention and knew he had to get in on the business. His initial investment he stated was $5 million dollars and he purchased a building for Netscape to use as an office. He would become the business maestro for Netscape as their success launched the Internet boom of the mid to late 1990s.

            In 1994, Netscape Communications launched in Silicone Valley and the Internet was becoming more and more popular, Netscape felt a great deal of urgency to push their web browser Navigator to the public and were rewarded with a massive success. By 1995, Netscape was preparing to go public and felt invincible. However, a Microsoft executive felt disrespected by a Netscape executive over a phone call, which led to Microsoft turning their focus on squashing Netscape.

        <p>Microsoft’s salespeople are described as assassins in the video, but a major factor in their salespeople’s success was Bill Gate’s bank account  and the decision to make Internet Explorer 4 freee with Windows and Office gutted Netscape’s user base. By 1997, the browser wars is over and Microsoft captures over 80% of browser users leaving Netscape good as done. This led to AOL’s acquisition of Netscape for $4.2 billion dollars and in 2015 AOL was acquired by Verizon for $4.4 billion dollars.

            Jim Clark’s initial investment in Netscape was $5 million dollars and by the time Netscape was sold to AOL, he had made $2 billion dollars. Microsoft on the other hand, rejoicing in the defeat of Netscape, was unprepared for the battle with the US Justice Department, which saw Bill Gates and his vision of using the Internet as a toll road as a technical terrorist. Microsoft was found guilty of anti-trust violations and was ruled to split the company however on appeal the order to split the business was rescinded. Bill Gates, who was drained from the browser war and a much larger legal, one hands off his CEO position to his lieutenant Steve Balmer.
